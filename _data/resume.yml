              Developing software with a focus on API-level data interoperability and companion applications to
              streamline the integrated use of sensing devices in the IDEA-FAST digital healthcare project.
              The Horizon 2020 project investigates digital endpoints in neurodegenerative and immune-mediated
              diseases to improve therapeutic intervention and quality of life.

              Doctoral researcher on novel family-focused interfaces for internet-connected services.
              _I started at Northumbria (2017) and transferred with my supervisor to Newcastle (2019)_.


              - Designed [Domestic Widgets](/domesticwidgets){:target="_blank"}, a 'physicalisation' IoT
              toolkit for families to create cardboard-based indicators that connect with various data sources through voice control.

              - Implemented natural language processing, embedded hardware and bespoke web services for secure
              data management and access by Domestic Widget users through the voice UI.

              - Developed a Google App Script ([Phone Grown](/phonegrown){:target="_blank"}), which transforms
              a Google Sheet into a user interface to create rule-based ambient information displays from 'left-over' phones.

              - Designed an accompanying UI in Google Sheets and written
              [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Turn-an-Unused-Smartphone-Into-a-Smart-Display/){:target="_blank"} supporting
              a do-it-yourself, scalable and open-source dissemination of this app.

              - Deployed both products at 5-10 families each for ~2 months; individually conducted observations and
              interviews to qualitatively study how domestic connected devices can be better designed with families in mind,
              and for which potential shared purposes.
