      Dev lead and senior software engineer in an agile dev team (6 devs, 3 QA engineers, and 2 business analysts), tasked with the development and maintenance of a new cloud-native payments architecture through modern, scalable, and modular technologies. This is developed in line with DWP's Strategic Reference Architecture (SRA) and the latest developments in the banking industry - in order "to ensure that people who get paid by DWP receive the right amount of money, at the right time into the right bank account".
      - Design and implement restful APIs to accept, process and enhance payment requests, focusing on idempotency (including deduplication), resiliency and recoverability.
      - Accommodate and architect these services for throughput and scalability to handle DWP paying over 20 million people and over 250 billion British pounds annually. 
      - Study and engage with "legacy" services to support and enable the modernisation of their financial systems without redeveloping their services.
      - Support and grow development team(s) in maturity through team building, working methods, redundancy in skills and responsibilities, collaborative exploration of best practices, and attention to personal development - regardless of job title.
      - Contribute to (company-wide) efforts to standardise quality and efficiency - including reusable CI/CD components.
      - Manage and represent a team of developers and the technical product, support management in estimating and prioritising upcoming work, maintain and argue for continuous improvements, and engage with architects, product managers and the wider business in the representation of the technical product.

      Node.JS backend software engineer in a medium-sized agile dev team (8-12, 2 BE engineers), tasked with the redesign and development of two new, modernized, web applications for the customer’s enterprise lifecycle management platform (JavaScript, Typescript, NoSQL, Express.js, NPM, Jest, InversifyJS, Swagger, Gitlab, AWS Cloud).
      - Architect and implement data synchronisation infrastructure, designed to ensure data consistency (and redundancy) between two applications which edit the same data entities (AWS Cloud: Step Functions, Lambda, Cloudwatch, SQS, SNS, S3, DynamoDB).
      - Lead large-scale migrations (>20.000 entities) across development and production environments.
      - Develop REST API endpoints, challenged with tight coupling to enterprise software and asynchronous upload processes for mixed-media entities (Node.JS, Express.js, AWS S3, Lambda, SQS).
      - Maintain and expand search functionality (Elastic Search), adopt changing data schematics (re-indexing) and develop event-driven data streaming and transforming pipelines (DynamoDB streams, Lambda).
      - Implement and coordinate code-quality and application monitoring improvements, such as real-time pipeline alerts in Microsoft Teams (AWS CloudWatch, SNS), test-suite for serverless code (AWS Lambdas) using the existing CI/CD, as well as improvements of code-review processes.

      Python software engineer, researcher, and technical support with a leading role in a small dev/research team (3-4), developing stable MVPs, supporting a global digital health research project (48 research institutes and companies) into consumer products for health monitoring of chronic-disease patients (Python, FastAPI, Poetry, Docker, NoSQL).
      - Design, develop, and maintain the ETL data pipeline, extracting physical sensor data from third-party APIs (Apache Airflow, Python, Docker, MongoDB).
      - Develop API endpoints for within-project services, providing access to temporary patient device credentials, pipeline statuses and product user-manual (Python, FastAPI, Docker), and maintain the corresponding reverse proxy router to provide access through a singular address (Traefik, Docker).
      - Manage the user-centred design and development of the research’s clinical study management dashboard.
      - Evaluate and assess usability and user experience of digital health technologies using literature, expert interviews, and patient feedback.
