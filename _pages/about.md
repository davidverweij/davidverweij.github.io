<br/><br/>
I am a creative technologist that builds digital and physical products, and currently finishing my Doctoral Thesis in Computer Science. Originally taught as an interactive product and experience designer, I currently have 5+ years part-time experience in software development for bespoke products and services. I have a creative and analytical mindset, am self-directed and resourceful, and eager to work in a team on high quality deliverables for meeting stakeholder expectations.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I experiment with designing software, hardware and product design, and enjoy woodworking and DIY on my house, being outdoors and (board)games.
