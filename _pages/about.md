<br/><br/>
With a background as an interactive product and experience developer, I have 6+ years of part-time experience in software development for bespoke products and services. I have a creative and analytical mindset, am self-directed and resourceful, and am eager to work in a team on high-quality deliverables that meet stakeholder expectations.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I experiment with designing software, hardware and product design, and enjoy woodworking and DIY on my house, being outdoors and (board)games.
