<br/><br/>
With a background in interactive product and technology development, I have developed software amongst small teams for bespoke MVPs and large agile teams for enterprise applications and longstanding running services. I am creative, self-directed, resourceful, and analytical – favouring documentation and diagrams. I am a keen participator in project processes, such as agile planning and estimations, and – where appropriate – naturally take on a leading role ideally in a managerial role. I enjoy working on debugging, automation, optimisations, and quality control, in both work processes and coding. In addition, I engage and improve in company processes, such as technical interviews, CSR, and mentoring activities. My current tech stack specialises in NodeJS backend engineering for rest APIs and microservices on AWS – though am a quick learner and confident across various languages.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I experiment with designing software, hardware and product design, and enjoy woodworking and DIY on my house, being outdoors and (board)games.
